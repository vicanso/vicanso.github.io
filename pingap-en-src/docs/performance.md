# Performance Testing

Performance testing is a complex process that depends on various scenarios. Below are some simple test scenarios.

CPU: M2

### Nginx (No Access Logging)

Nginx is used here for comparison purposes

```bash
wrk 'http://127.0.0.1:9080/' --latency

Running 10s test @ http://127.0.0.1:9080/
  2 threads and 10 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev

Threads: 3 (Setting to 3 threads shows little improvement over 2 threads, likely due to global locks or similar factors - to be confirmed later)

```bash
wrk 'http://127.0.0.1:6188/proxy-nginx'  --latency

### Compression

Testing client compression performance with different compression formats (data is read from memory, so the main time cost is in compression processing). All compression algorithms are set to level 9; adjust as needed in actual use.

Client without compression support (24KB response data)

```bash
wrk 'http://localhost:6118/' --latency
Running 10s test @ http://localhost:6118/
  2 threads and 10 connections
